# 🧠 My Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This is a collection of various ML/DataScience projects I've worked on. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Project 1: Virtual Mouse**
  - **Description**: A computer vision project that enables users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It utilizes pre-trained models for hand tracking to create an innovative, hands-free interaction experience.
  - **Technologies**: Python, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV
  - **Dataset**: No external dataset; real-time webcam input is used for hand tracking
